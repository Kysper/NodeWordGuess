# NodeWordGuess

* The game I attempted to make was a Horror themed word game based on horror movies.The idea was to give the player a random word that has been converted to an underscore and as they typed an input character the input was to be passed through a constructor and then if correct would reveal the characters to the player otherwise they would lose a remainingguess until zero where the would have to start over.

* I am missing some code to make it functional some stuff I have to continue to work on is:

*Work on creating if and or switch statements to determine if the character that was chosen was one in the array of letters or not I think I could do that by passing in the argument inside the charSwap function*

*Secondly I could not seem to get the correct statement to fire off I do suspect it having to do something with the charSwap not currently operational so I believe it would start working if I have in the place the correct variables needed to solve the issue and to formulate a solution for the charSwap function on the letter contructor*


* I do believe I was being confused quite a bit with all the variables and changing them around to build out the objects to call the functions with.

* I currently have working the ability to spawn a word into the console and to log character input and decrease the guessesRemaining on wrongful choices(Currently they all are.). The constructors mostly seem to work except for the charSwap part which I am currently developing a solution still I just will not have time to finish it tonight so I will contiue to work on it after turning it in.

* The attempt here was to challenge myself, While I knew this was going to be to hard for me I wanted to see how far I could get with what I knew.
